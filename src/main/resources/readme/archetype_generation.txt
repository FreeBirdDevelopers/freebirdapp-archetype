Calling mvn archetype:create-from-project the plugin first resolves the package by guessing the project directory.

It then generates the directory tree of the archetype in the target/generated-sources/archetype directory.

Then move to that generated directory and call mvn install on the created archetype.

$ cd target/generated-sources/archetype/
$ mvn install

Finally move to a fresh directory and use your archetype.
$ mkdir /tmp/archetype
$ cd /tmp/archetype
$ mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeCatalog=local
